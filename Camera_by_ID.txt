lsusb -a ==> gives info on all devices connected 

to get index of a particular camera 

ls -a ~/dev/v4l/by-id ==> the output will be the index0 file of format {Vendor_ID}_{Product_ID}-video-index0

Now, insert the path to this file in cv2.VideoCapture({Insert_path}) ==> will always pick a particular camera with the desired Serial_ID and hence no need to use udev rules to create sym link
